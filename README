Make CSS more readable.

What's differences with built-in CSS syntax in Vim:
    1. Support most of HTML & CSS properties, including HTML5 & CSS3.
    2. Different highlight colors for properties, value, units and so on.

NOTICE:
    DO NOT support CSS color plugin yet, I'll fix it when I have time.

Install:
    just copy css.vim to your ~/.vim/Syntax.
    Recommeneded:
        I wrote this script under Windows and different OS has different file formats, so do as following:
        Create a new empty css.vim file in syntax folder, and copy this code to the new one.
